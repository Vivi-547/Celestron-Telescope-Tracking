# Celestron-Telescope-Tracking
This project implements a Celestron dioptric telescope tracker using Python. The goal is to control the telescope to accurately track celestial objects based on their Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) coordinates. The tracker uses a Tkinter GUI interface to allow users to select celestial objects easily and initiate tracking.
